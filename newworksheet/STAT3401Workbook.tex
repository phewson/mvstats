\chapter*{Introduction}

Hello and welcome to the multivariate statistics part of STAT3401.   One word of caution about these notes.   The first column of the notes will have either a $>$ or a $+$ symbol denoting the R prompt or the ``R command carrying over an additional line''.   You don't need to type that in.  

I might put some of the longer R functions in the portal, to save a little typing.   Nevertheless, you do need to \emph{understand} what you are doing.
