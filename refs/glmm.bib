Commonly in the social and behavioral sciences and increasingly in epidemiologic research, multiple indicators are utilized as responses in lieu of an  obvious single measure for an outcome of interest. In this article we study the concomitant latent class model for analyzing such multivariate categorical outcome data. We develop practical theory for reducing and identifying such models. We detail parameter and standard error fitting that parallels standard latent class methodology, thus supplementing the approach proposed by Dayton and Macready. We propose and study diagnostic strategies, exemplifying our methods using physical disability data from an ongoing gerontologic study. Throughout, the focus of our work is on applications for which a primary goal is to study the association between health or functioning and covariates.},

  ANNOTE = {Recently, there has been increased interest in the geographical modelling of two or more diseases. In this article, we consider a number of issues relating to such an endeavour including the standardization process and the comparison of univariate and bivariate disease mapping models. A principle motivation for the examination of two or more diseases is to discover similarities or dissimilarities in the geographical distribution of risk. In this article, we propose a proportional mortality approach to give clues to areas of similarity and dissimilarity. A secondary aim of bivariate modelling is to 'borrow strength' between diseases in order to provide better estimates of risk in each area. We will illustrate various modelling strategies using incidence data from 1996 to 2000 on lung and bladder cancer in Washington state.}

The finite mixture model is preferred overall by statistical model selection criteria. Two points of support adequately describe the distribution of the unobserved heterogeneity, suggesting two latent populations, the 'healthy' and the 'ill' whose fitted distributions differ substantially from each other},

We show that individuals in the infrequent and frequent user latent classes may be described as being healthy and ill, respectively.

  ANNOTE = {This article discusses and extends statistical models to jointly analyse the spatial variation of rates of several diseases with common risk factors. We start with a review of methods for separate analyses of diseases, then move to ecological regression approaches, where the rates from one of the diseases enter as surrogate covariates for exposure. Finally, we propose a general framework for jointly modelling the variation of two or more diseases, some of which share latent spatial fields, but with possibly different risk gradients. In our application, we consider mortality data on oral, oesophagus, larynx and lung cancers for males in Germany, which all share smoking as a common risk factor. Furthermore, the first three cancers are also known to be related to excessive alcohol consumption. An empirical comparison of the different models based on a formal model criterion as well as on the posterior precision of the relative risk estimates strongly suggests that the joint modelling approach is a useful and valuable extension over individual analyses.}

annote = {It is common in public health research to have high-dimensional, multivariate, spatially referenced data representing summaries of geographic regions. Often, it is desirable to examine relationships among these variables both within and across regions. An existing modeling technique called spatial factor analysis has been used and assumes that a common spatial factor underlies all the variables and causes them to be related to one another. An extension of this technique considers that there may be more than one underlying factor, and that relationships among the underlying latent variables are of primary interest. However, due to the complicated nature of the covariance structure of this type of data, existing methods are not satisfactory. We thus propose a generalized spatial structural equation model. In the first level of the model, we assume that the observed variables are related to particular underlying factors. In the second level of the model, we use the structural equation method to model the relationship among the underlying factors and use parametric spatial distributions on the covariance structure of the underlying factors. We apply the model to county-level cancer mortality and census summary data for Minnesota, including socioeconomic status and access to public utilities.

The approach of the paper is fully parametric and Bayesian. The Bayes factor is calculated with the Savage-Dickey density ratio and used for model selection. The model is applied to two different micro data sets, the 1987-1988 National Medical Expenditure Survey and the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The paper studies the effect of managed care and fee- for-service type of private insurance on the demand for healthcare. It also compares the effects of private insurance and Medicaid in covering health care expenses of elderly Americans.},

  NOTES = {Various research areas face the methodological problems presented by nonnegative integer count data drawn from heterogeneous populations. We present a disaggregate negative binomial regression procedure for analysis of count data observed for a heterogeneous sample of cross-sections, possibly over some fixed time periods. This procedure simultaneously pools or groups cross-sections while estimating a separate negative binomial regression model for each group. An E-M algorithm is described within a maximum likelihood framework to estimate the group proportions, the group-specific regression coefficients, and the degree of overdispersion in event rates within each derived group. The proposed procedure is illustrated with count data entailing nonnegative integer counts of purchases (events) for a frequently bought consumer good.},

We show that whilst Grobner bases help to explain the local geometry of these spaces a complimentary analysis, modelling the positivity of probabilities, enhances and completes the geometrical picture. We report some recent geometrical results in this area and discuss a possible general methodology for the analyses of such problems.},

An EM algorithm for estimation is described, and the algorithm is applied to data on customer purchases of books offered through direct mail. Our model is compared empirically to a number of other approaches that deal with heterogeneity in Poisson regression models. }

This study reviews the different ways in which dependencies among the variables involved in these models are accommodated. It is demonstrated that the standard and concomitant variable mixture models identify groups of observations and at the same time discriminate them analogous, respectively, to discriminant analysis and logistic regression. While the mixture regression model is shown to have limited use for classifying new observations. An extension of it, called the saturated mixture regression model, is shown to be more useful in that respect.  Advantages of that model in model estimation when missing data are present and as a framework for model selection are also discussed.},
