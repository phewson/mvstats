In essence, we wish to form projections $\boldsymbol{z} = (z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{q})$  of the \emph{standardised} data $\boldsymbol{x} = (x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{p})$ 

\begin{eqnarray*}
z_{1} &=& e_{11} x_{1} + e_{12} x_{2} + \ldots e_{1p} x_{p}\\
z_{2} &=& e_{21} x_{1} + e_{22} x_{2} + \ldots e_{2p} x_{p}\\
\ldots\\
z_{q} &=& e_{q1} x_{1} + e_{q2} x_{2} + \ldots e_{qp} x_{p}
\end{eqnarray*}

where the coefficients  $\boldsymbol{E}$ form a $p \times q$ matrix.   If dimension reduction is our goal, clearly we hope that we can form an adequate representation of the data with $q<p$.
