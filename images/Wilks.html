*Samuel Wilks* attended school in Denton, then studied architecture at
North Texas State Teachers College. He received a B.A. in architecture
in 1926. However his eyesight was not too good, and he feared that this
would be a handicap if he pursured architecture as a profession so he
decided on a career in mathematics.

During session 1926-27 Wilks taught at a school in Austin, Texas and at
the same time he began to study mathematics at the University of Texas.
Here he was taught set theory and other courses in advanced mathematics
by Robert Moore <../Mathematicians/Moore_Robert.html> and he took
courses in probability
<javascript:win1('../Glossary/probability_theory',350,200)> and
statistics with E L Dodd. Wilks received an M.A. in mathematics in 1928
and during this time, in fact from 1927 until 1929, he was an instructor
in mathematics.

Wilks was awarded a fellowship to the University of Iowa where he
studied for his doctorate. Here H L Rietz, who supervised his doctorate,
introduced him to Gosset <../Mathematicians/Gosset.html>'s theory of
small samples and R A Fisher <../Mathematicians/Fisher.html>'s
statistical methods. After receiving his doctorate in 1931, on small
sample theory of 'matched' groups in educational psychology, he
continued research at Columbia University in session 1931-32.

In 1932 Wilks went to England where he spent a period in Karl Pearson
<../Mathematicians/Pearson.html>'s department in University College,
London. In 1933 he went to Cambridge where he worked with John Wishart
<../Mathematicians/Wishart.html>, who had been a research assistant to
both Pearson <../Mathematicians/Pearson.html> and Fisher
<../Mathematicians/Fisher.html>.

He was appointed instructor of mathematics at Princeton in 1933. He was
to remain there for the rest of his career, being promoted to professor
of mathematical statistics in 1944.

Wilks's work was all on mathematical statistics. His early papers on
multivariate analysis were his most important, one of most influential
being /Certain generalizations in the analysis of variance/. He
constructed multivariate generalisations of the correlation ratio and
the coefficient of multiple correlation and studied random samples from
a normal multivariate population.

Three papers in 1931-33 concerned deriving the sample distributions of
estimates of the parameters of a bivariate normal distribution when some
of the individuals gave observations on both variables, some others on
only one. In 1935 he investigated multinomial distributions. He advanced
the work of Neyman <../Mathematicians/Neyman.html> on the theory of
confidence-interval estimation. In 1941 Wilks developed his theory of
'tolerance limits'.

Wilks was a founder member of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics
(1935). He was editor of the Annals of Mathematical Statistics from 1938
until 1949.

Wilks served the U.S. government in many roles. Among many other similar
tasks, he worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and was a member
of the National Defense Committee. In 1947 he was awarded the
Presidential Certificate of Merit for his contributions to antisubmarine
warfare and the solution of convoy problems.
